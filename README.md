This site was created to make cat memes using HTML, JS and CSS. It can use a randomly selected image from a database or a user uploaded image. The user can add text to the image and then download the image. Confetti and a cat sound will play when the image is downloaded. This was my first time using HTML canvases and I learned a lot about how to manipulate images in JS. There is a secret on the website that I will let you find on your own, so good luck!

If the site is running slow, just keep the developer console open. I'm not sure why but its much faster...
